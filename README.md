# No-show-Prediction---Project-Data-Science-and-DL-
dependently developed a machine learning solution to predict whether a patient would attend or miss their medical appointment. - Collected and preprocessed appointment data, performed exploratory data analysis, handled
class imbalance, encoded categorical variables, and engineered relevant features. The model was trained on features including: Patient ID, Gender, Nationality, Medical Specialty, Doctor Name, and appointment-related attributes.
Applied multiple classification models, includingXGBoost (78.2% accuracy), Voting Classifier with XGBoost, Random Forest, and LightGBM (77.2%), and Neural Network (77% accuracy).
